It's an engaging way to combine Scratch programming with real-time computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Play Pong using finger tracking, no mouse or keyboard needed.
- Simple and intuitive controls powered by your webcam.
- Responsive and smooth finger-tracking using basic computer vision concepts.
- Ideal for beginners learning about computer vision and Scratch.
